# Consolv 1.0

Consolv 1.0 is a tool for predicting whether water molecules bound to the surface of a protein are likely to be conserved or displaced in other, independently-solved crystallographic structures of the same protein. Consolv was developed by members of the Protein Structural Analysis and Design Laboratory at Michigan State University, and was supported in part by NSF grant DBI-9600831.

## Installation

Consolv can be compiled under Unix systems. To install Consolv, perform the following steps:

- Download the Consolv directory from GitHub and unzip it
- Place the unzipped directory in the directory into which you wish to install the software, and enter the following command: 
    - `tar -zxvf consolv.tar.gz`

    Among the files created will be a file called ahplist.dat. This file contains the atomic hydrophilicity values for various atom types commonly found in crystallographic protein structures. It is sometimes convenient to move this file to a common directory where all users may edit this file in order to add new atom types. If you wish to move the ahplist.dat file, you should do so before the following step.

- To compile the software, select the proper compiler in src/Makefile. For example, for SGI, you can use the following two lines and comment the others:
    + Use the following two lines for SGI's CC compiler:

    `CC = cc`    
    `OPT = -O2`  

    Then use the following command from the directory where Consolv was unpacked:

    `./Install`

    The install command will ask you for two directories: the location of the ahplist.dat file, and the location of the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB) files. You should use complete path names, and no environment variables or shell expansion characters (i.e. do not use ~username, $HOME, etc.). Consolv will now be compiled using the file locations specified. If you later wish to change the default file locations, you can re-run ./Install from the Consolv installation directory.

- To run Consolv, run the Consolv script in the installation directory. For example, if Consolv is installed in /usr/local/biochem/consolv, then you would use the command:

    - `/usr/local/biochem/consolv/Consolv`

    to run the software.

#### Troubleshooting Shell Scripts

Many of the individual commands that make up Consolv are shell scripts. These scripts assume that the C-shell, the Bourne-shell and the Korn-shell are installed in the standard locations. If you have difficulty running one or more of these scripts, you may edit the first line of each script to point to the correct shell location for your system. Consolv scripts which are dependent on shell locations include:


| **Script**      | **Shell** |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Consolv         | /bin/sh   |
| Install         | /bin/sh   |
| sumpred         | /bin/ksh  |
| bin/allwats     | /bin/csh  |
| bin/consolv2pdb | /bin/sh   |
| bin/extract     | /bin/csh  |

If you do not have `ksh` installed on your system, try using `sh` instead. Some versions of sh have extended features similar to those found in `ksh`.

## Running Consolv

#### Overview of Usage

Consolv can be run in one of three modes. The most common usage of Consolv is to take a single crystallographic protein structure, extract environmental information about each of the water molecules in the structure, and then predict whether each water molecule in the first-hydration shell is likely to be conserved or displaced in an independently-solved structure of the same protein. This is accomplished by running Consolv in application mode.

Test mode can be used to test the predictive accuracy of Consolv using a pair of structures of the same protein. This mode requires two independently-solved crystallographic structures of the same protein, superimposed into the same coordinate system. As in application mode, environmental information is extracted for waters in the first hydration shell of the first structure, and the conserved/displaced status of each water molecule is predicted. In test mode, however, an additional accuracy test is done using the second structure. The actual conserved/displaced status of each first shell water with regard to the second crystallographic structure is determined, and the predictions given by Consolv are compared to the actual conservation between the two structures. This mode may be useful in testing the accuracy of Consolv on a particular class of proteins, verifying that Consolv is running correctly, etc.

In either application or test mode, Consolv's default predictions are optimized for all first-shell water molecules. The `-a` flag can be used to instruct Consolv to optimize predictions for active-site water molecules only. The resulting predictions will be more accurate for active-site water molecules at the expense of other first-shell water molecules. This flag should be used when only predictions for waters near the active site are desired. To obtain predictions for both active-site and non-active-site water molecules, run Consolv twice: once with the `-a` flag, and once without.

In environment mode, no conserved/displaced predictions are made. The environmental information for all waters from a single protein structure are extracted and placed into output files, and then Consolv exits.

**NOTE: Please use the `-v` flag to activate the verbose output.**

#### Preparing Coordinate Files

**Application Mode**

Running Consolv in application mode usually requires no preprocessing of PDB files. However, if your PDB file includes explicit hydrogen coordinates, they should be removed prior to running Consolv. There is a simple script, called pdbdehydrogen, which is included with Consolv, and can be used for this purpose. To remove hydrogen coordinates from a PDB file, you can use this script as follows:

- `pdbdehydrogen OldPDBfile > NewPDBfile`

After this step is completed, you are ready to continue on to the next section: Running Consolv in Application Mode.

**Test Mode**

Test mode requires several additional preparation steps. As for application mode, any explicit hydrogen coordinates should be removed from coordinate files before running Consolv. Test mode requires two independently-solved structures of the same protein, which must both be in the same coordinate system. Thus, the next step in preparing structures to use with Consolv in test mode is to superimpose the two structures into a common coordinate system. In development and testing of Consolv, this step was performed using InsightII molecular graphics software from Molecular Simulations, Inc. However, any software capable of superimposing the backbone atoms of the two structures and writing a PDB-formatted file will suffice. Since large conformational changes in the protein backbone between the two structures can affect Consolv's identification of conserved waters, a root mean squared deviation of less than 1.0 Ã… for backbone atoms is desirable.

When running in test mode, Consolv tags the active-site atoms of the protein so that active-site results can be analyzed independently of other first-shell water molecules. Identification of the active-site requires that Consolv be able to identify the protein atoms and the ligand atoms in the PDB file -- this is done using the PDB chain ID. The chain ID is a single-letter identifier found in column 22 of ATOM and HETATM records of the PDB file. For peptidal ligands, most PDB files will already have independent chain ID's for the protein and the ligand. For ligands composed entirely of HETATMS, however, the ligand may not have a chain ID at all. When Consolv is run in test mode, it will prompt you for the chain ID of the protein, and the chain ID of the ligand, and it will use this information to determine the active-site location. If the protein and ligand do not have distinct chain ID's in the PDB files, they must be added using a text editor. When adding chain ID's, it is easiest to use a single chain ID for all protein atoms, and another chain ID for all ligand atoms.

The following example shows several ATOM and HETATM records from a PDB file with the chain ID "P" assigned to protein atoms and the chain ID "I" (for inhibitor) assigned to ligand atoms:

```python
ATOM   1485  C   VAL P 186       1.503 -12.869  15.079  1.00 64.80      1DR31641

```

In the example above, the bound Thio-NADP+ (TAP) is considered a part of the protein, and is thus labeled with a chain ID of "P", while the biopterin ligand atoms are labeled with a chain ID of "I". Once the two coordinate files are properly superimposed and chain ID's have been added, they are ready for use by Consolv in test mode.

**Environment Mode**

As with application mode, minimal preparation is needed to run Consolv in environment mode. Any explicit hydrogen coordinates should be removed from the PDB file as described in the section on preparing to run Consolv in application mode. Once any hydrogens have been removed from your PDB file.

#### Running Consolv in Application Mode

Once a protein coordinate file has been prepared as described above, running Consolv in application mode is straightforward, simply execute the following command:

- `Consolv [-a] protPDBCode protPDBFile`

Where protPDBCode is the PDB code of the protein to work with, and protPDBFile is the full pathname of the file containing the coordinates of the protein. If the protein has not yet been assigned a PDB code, you may use any 4-character combination of digits and letters. The PDB code is included in the output files to identify the water molecules being classified.

If the `-a` flag is included, predictions are tuned for active-site water molecules. In this case, only predictions for the water molecules in or near the active-site of the protein are likely to be correct. To obtain accurate predictions for waters that are not proximal to the active site, run Consolv without the `-a` flag.

If the Consolv directory is not in the execution path, you may need to specify the entire path name to the Consolv script. The following is an example of running Consolv in application mode where the Consolv directory is /usr/local/Consolv, and the PDB file pdb3apr.ent has been copied or linked to the current directory:

- `/usr/local/Consolv/Consolv 3apr pdb3apr.ent`

You may now use sumpred to view the prediction results, as described in the section describing Output Files generated by Consolv.

#### Running Consolv in Test Mode

Running Consolv in test mode is similar to running in application mode, but there are a few more details which must be included on the command line. Specifically, Consolv needs to know the chain ID's of the protein and the ligand. This information is used to find and label the active-site protein atoms and water molecules. For details on assigning chain ID's in the PDB file, see the section on preparing coordinate files for use with Consolv.

Consolv can be run in test mode using any two independently-solved structures of the same protein. At least one of the two structures must be a complex between the protein and an inhibitor or other ligand, so that the active-site of the protein may be identified. Only the PDB file for this complex needs to have chain ID's assigned. Once the PDB files are prepared, you can run Consolv in test mode using the following command line:

- `Consolv [-a] protPDB cplxPDB protFile cplxFile protID ligID`

Where Consolv is the full path to the main Consolv script, protPDB is the PDB code for the ligand-free protein structure (or the one without chain ID's assigned, if any), cplxPDB is the PDB code for the complex structure (which must have chain ID's assigned), protFile is the full path name for the protein structure PDB file, cplxFile is the full path name for the complex structure PDB file, protID is the chain ID for the protein in the complex structure, and ligID is the chain ID for the ligand in the complex structure.

If the `-a` flag is included, predictions are tuned for active-site water molecules. In this case, only predictions for the water molecules in or near the active-site of the protein are likely to be correct. To obtain accurate predictions for waters that are not proximal to the active site, run Consolv without the `-a` flag.

The following example should work correctly, assuming that /usr/local/Consolv is replaced with the correct pathname for Consolv, and the PDB files `pdb2apr.ent` and `pdb3apr.ent` are copied or linked to the current directory:

- `/usr/local/Consolv/Consolv 2apr 3apr pdb2apr.ent pdb3apr.ent E I`

You may now use `sumpred` to view the prediction results, as described in the section on Output Files generated by Consolv.

#### Running Consolv in Environment Mode

Running Consolv in environment mode is identical to running in application mode, except that the keyword noscale is included as the last command-line parameter. For example, if Consolv is installed in `/usr/local/Consolv`, and the PDB file `pdb2apr.ent` is present in the current directory, then you would invoke Consolv in environment mode as follows:

- `/usr/local/Consolv/Consolv 2apr pdb2apr.ent noscale`

You may now use sumpred to view the prediction results, as described in the section on Output Files generated by Consolv.

## Output Files

The classification results produced by Consolv are split across several output files. To produce a human-readable summary of these results, use the `sumpred` program in the Consolv directory. Make sure you are in the same directory as the output files from a Consolv run, and then type:

- `/usr/local/Consolv/sumpred PDBcode`

Replacing `/usr/local/Consolv/` with the directory in which you have installed Consolv locally, and PDBcode with the PDB code of the protein for which you are classifying water molecules. If you do, for example, `sumpred 2apr`, `sumpred` will expect the files `2apr.pred` and `2apr.act`, both of which are produced by Consolv, to be present in the current directory.

Sumpred will display a summary to your screen. You may redirect this output to a file in the usual way. For example:

- `sumpred 2apr > 2apr.consolv`

The details included in the summary include Residue number of each water, its predicted classification (Disp = displaced, Cons = conserved), and the number of votes that were cast for each class, which can act as a measure of confidence in each prediction. For details on voting and the classification process, see the section on Algorithmic Details. If Consolv was run in test mode, then the summary will also include a comparison of Consolv's predictions with the conserved/displaced status of each water as observed by superimposing the two structures and comparing water molecule positions.

During a run, Consolv produces various output files. Files which are necessary for sumpred include `*.pred`, `*.cons`, `*.env`, and `*.actsite.hits`. Other files contain intermediate results, or auxiliary information about the protein. A summary of Consolv output files follows. Filenames for these additional output files are often of the form `PDBcode.*`, where PDB is the PDB code of the protein which produced this output file, or `PDBfile.*`, where PDBfile is the filename of the PDB file which was used as input to Consolv.

## Diagnostics

The most common warning message seen when running Consolv is similar to the following:

```
WARNING - Unknown atom type!
Can't find AHPhil value for...
Atom: NH2A Residue: ARG
Using average AHP value of 0.351000 for: N
```

This indicates that Consolv is unsure of the exact value to use for the atomic hydrophilicity of an atom of type NH2A in the context of an ARG residue. For most protein atoms, this often means that an unusual nomenclature was used for this atom in the PDB file. This warning is more common for HETATMs, since only a small subset of the many types of HETATMs which can appear in a PDB file are known to Consolv.

The atomic hydrophilicity values for every atom type known to Consolv are stored in the file ahplist.dat This file is probably installed in the same directory as the rest of Consolv, but it can be installed elsewhere, as described in the section covering Consolv Installation. If you wish to add additional atom types to this file, you may edit the file as described in the next section, Input Files and Adjustable Parameters. If Consolv does not find an exact match for the atom and residue in ahplist.dat, it will use the average hydrophilicity value for all atoms of the same type. In the example above, an unknown type of nitrogen atom is assigned a hydrophilicity value equal to the average value for all types of nitrogen atoms. The average values to use are also assigned in the file `ahplist.dat`.

## Input Files & Adjustable Parameters

Other than the PDB files it is currently processing, Consolv only references one additional datafile. This file is the `ahplist.dat` file mentioned in the previous section. This file contains the atomic hydrophilicity values for many common protein atom types and HETATMs in the context of various residues. This file may be edited to include new atom types and alternate names for existing atom types. Each entry of this file has the following format:

```
ATOM    RESIDUE    VALUE
```

`ATOM` is the name of the atom, exactly as it appears in the PDB file `ATOM` or `HETATM` record. Similarly, `RESIDUE` is the residue name, however the symbol * may be used to match any residue name. The `VALUE` is the atomic hydrophilicity value to assign to atoms of this type.

## Scripts & Tools Provided

Several additional tools are provided in the bin subdirectory of the Consolv installation directory, including:

`extract`

This script can be used to extract a subset of the available features from a `.env` file produced by Consolv. Usage is:

- `extract feature-list envfile`

Where feature-list may include any or all of the following tags:

| ï»¿TAG   | Feature                                      |
|-------|----------------------------------------------|
| adn   | Atomic Density                               |
| ahp   | Atomic Hydrophilicity                        |
| bval  | B-Value                                      |
| hbdp  | # Hydrogen-bonds to protein atoms            |
| hbdw  | # Hydrogen-bonds to other water molecules    |
| mob   | Mobility                                     |
| nbval | Net B-value of neighboring protein atoms     |
| abval | Average B-value of neighboring protein atoms |
| cons  | Conserved/Displaced tag                      |
| as    | Active-site tag                              |

For example, to extract only atomic density and atomic hydrophilicity information from the `.env` file for the aspartic protease `2APR`, you would use:

- `extract ahp adn 2apr.env`

`consolv2pdb`


This script takes Consolv's conserved/displaced predictions, and produces two PDB-formatted files - one containing all the waters predicted by Consolv to be conserved, and the other containing all the waters predicted to be displaced. This can be useful for visualizing Consolv's prediction results via molecular graphics software. The program is executed as follows:

- `consolv2pdb PDBcode`

The script expects the files `PDBcode.pred`, `PDBcode.env`, and `PDBcode.ent` to be found in the current directory. It produces two files: `PDBcode.preddisp`, and `PDBcode.predcons`. Both are PDB-formatted files containing only water molecules, and should be viewable by most molecular graphics software.
